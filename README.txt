## Usage

- Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19A6xIVhpaDiVfeExI3M0p__8oQl3rU7D?usp=sharing
- Execute code blocks as instructed at the beginning of the section A and the Section B
- (Optional) Execute other block to see the accuracy results for other models.

## Local settings
- The notebook has been configured to use the local running image for better performance, therefore, it is important to change remote instance if you do not have the local execution environment running.
- If you run hyperparameter fitting for verifying the results, adjust `n_jobs` according to your environment computational capabilities.
- Finally, adjust the paths to the datasets' CSVs in the prelude blocks depending on your configuration of the environment.
